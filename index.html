        <h1> About Sylvia Leakehe </h1>
        <p> Hi! My name is Sylvia Leakehe. I am 19 years old and am from Tooele, Utah. Here are some fun facts about me:  </p>
        <h2>Interests</h1>
        <p> One thing I enjoy doing is reading. Some of my favorite books are A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Housseini and Little Women by Louisa M. Alcott. Another interest of mine is baking.
             Some of my favorite treats to bake are brownies, cakes, or any fun recipes I find online. Last, I love traveling!
              I think it is so cool to see new places and cultures. Of the places I've been, my favorites are Hawaii, Tonga, and New York City. </p>

        <h2>Education</h1>
        <p> I graduated from Tooele High School in May 2024 and am currently a freshman at BYU Provo. I am a pre-business major and am planning on majoring in accounting. After my undergrad, I'd like to get my masters in accounting or get my MBA.  </p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
            <p> Family has always been super important to me. I come from a family of 7, which consists of my parents, my 4 siblings, and me. I also have a brother in law and a neice and nephew. 
                I am the fourth child with 3 older sistes and 1 younger brother. My mom is from Idaho and my dad is from Tonga, but we have lived in Utah my whole life. 
                Both my parents come from big families so I've grown up with lots of cousins, and aunts, and uncles which has been a lot of fun!      </p>
